# ComposeReiDoFifa

This is my first finished app for Android. The idea behind it goes back to 2010 when a group of friends and I used to play Fifa 10 offline and keep all the scores and statistics on a shared google sheet. Thinking on that, I made this app. Even though we don't play it anymore, it was a nice study development.

The app was built with Kotlin and I used:
- Jetpack Compose
- FirebaseAuth for authentication
- FirebaseFirestore as database
- Hilt for dependencies injection
